# Goal


The goal of this project is to develop a Bayesian model for predicting and explaining house prices in Ames, Iowa.

Given the multifaceted nature of this task, we have opted to follow a comprehensive approach:

Model Diversity: we explore a variety of models sourced from well-established research domains, including Mixed Effect Models, Autoregressive Processes, Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) Models, Gaussian Processes and Latent Gaussian Markov Random Fields.
Model Selection: we rigorously assess the performance of each model and the posterior inclusion probabilities of the regressors. This meticulous selection process guides us in choosing the most effective models.
Model Ensembling: we create an ensemble model that amalgamates the capabilities of the chosen models using Akaike weights. This ensemble approach enhances our predictive accuracy and robustness.
